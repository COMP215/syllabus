# Computer Science 215 - Algorithms

Professor [Tom Armstrong](http://www.tarmstro.com/), Wheaton College, Fall 2016

#### Meeting Information:

* Meeting Times: MTuW at 3:30 in SC1315

#### Catalog Description:

> An introduction to the mathematical foundations, design, implementation and computational analysis of fundamental algorithms. Problems include heuristic searching, sorting, several graph theory problems, tree balancing algorithms, and the theoretical expression of their orders of growth. Out-of-class assignments and in-class labs emphasize the balance between theoretical hypotheses and experimental verification. C/C++, Java, Perl or Maple are applied to various solutions.

## Workload

It is the expectation for all classes taught at Wheaton College that one hour of class time may expect two to three hours of preparation outside of class.  In addition to preparation time, programming assignments are designed to take a significant amount of time per week.  Start all assignments _early_. **No late work is accepted**.

## Academic Integrity

All work and submissions in this course must be entirely your own original content.  Assignments and examinations are to be done individually unless otherwise specified.  Laboratories are collaborative and should be done in pairs.  Resources (electronic and print) that contain documentation about programming languages are typically allowed, but those containing implementations of assignment components -- except the course texts -- are off limits.  At the discretion of the instructor, violations of academic integrity will result in penalties up to and including failing the course and reporting the violation to the College Hearing Board. If you have general questions/concerns or specific instances to discuss, do not hesitate to ask in class or privately.

## Accommodation

In compliance with the Wheaton College policy and equal access laws, a Dean is available to discuss appropriate accommodations that may be recommended for students with disabilities. Requests for accommodations are to be made during the first two weeks of the semester so that timely and appropriate arrangements can be made.
